# OpenVario
Very basic vario for paraglider and glider pilots, designed to be as cheap as possible.<br />
<br />
The goal is to have a screen, a buzzer, and a gps. It will make noise like any vario, display vertical speed, horizontal speed, time, time since takeoff, and other information if needed. It will also record the gps track.<br />
<br />
Currently, it is extremely basic. It is simply an arduino with an altimeter and a screen. The vertical speed is displayed with numbers as well as with a load bar.<br />
The project is currently on hold, but will continue when I can dedicate some time to it.
